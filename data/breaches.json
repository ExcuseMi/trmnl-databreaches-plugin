Comprised of email addresses and passwords from previous data breaches, these lists are used by attackers to compromise other, unrelated accounts of victims who have reused their passwords. The data also included 1.3 billion unique passwords, which are now searchable in Pwned Passwords. Working to turn breached data into awareness, Synthient partnered with HIBP to help victims of cybercrime understand their exposure."
